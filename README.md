## Usage

To interact with Shrekbot, join a Discord server where the bot is present. Use the following command to initiate a search and request content:

- `/request [query]`: Initiates a search and returns the top ten results in a drop-down list.

Once you enter the `/request` command followed by your query, Shrekbot will perform the search and present the results in a drop-down list. The first result will be automatically selected, and its details, including title, description, release date, and poster, will be displayed.

You can change the selection as many times as you want by using the drop-down list to navigate through the list. When you find the desired content, simply click the "Request" button to submit your request.

Shrekbot will process the request and communicate with Ombi to add the selected content to the media library. You will receive a notification when the requested content becomes available.

### Examples:

- `/request Shrek`: Initiates a search for the movie "Shrek" and presents the results.
- `/request Game of Thrones`: Initiates a search for the TV show "Game of Thrones" and presents the results.

Feel free to explore and request your favorite movies and TV shows with Shrekbot!

## Enabling Notifications in Ombi

To enable notifications for content availability, follow these steps in Ombi:

1. Go to Ombi settings.
2. Select the "Notifications" tab.
3. Under the "Webhook" section, check the "Enabled" checkbox.
4. In the "Base Url" field, enter the location where the bot is hosted, followed by `:8154/webhook`. For example, if the bot is hosted at `http://192.168.1.1`, enter `http://192.168.1.1:8154/webhook`.
5. Save the settings.

By enabling notifications in Ombi and providing the correct base URL, Shrekbot will be able to send notifications to the specified channel when the requested content becomes available to watch.
