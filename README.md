## Description

Shrekbot is a Discord bot inspired by the lovable ogre himself, Shrek. It allows users to request movies or TV shows to be added to Ombi, a media request platform, using API calls. With Shrekbot, requests can be made directly within the Discord client, making it convenient and fun for users to discover and request their favorite content. Additionally, Shrekbot can notify users when the requested content becomes available to watch, ensuring they never miss out on their favorite shows and movies.

## Features

- **Seamless Requesting**: Users can easily request movies or TV shows to be added to Ombi with simple commands right in the Discord client.
- **Ombi Integration**: Shrekbot uses API calls to communicate with Ombi, ensuring accurate and efficient processing of requests.
- **Notifications**: Shrekbot can notify users when the content they requested becomes available, keeping them updated and ready to watch.
- **Shrek-themed Interface**: Embrace the charm of Shrek with a bot that reflects the spirit of the beloved ogre.

### Configuration

Before running Shrekbot, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `ombitoken`: Secret token of the Ombi server.
- `ombiip`: IP address of the Ombi server.
- `ombiport`: Port number of the Ombi server.
- `clientid`: Discord bot ID.
- `guildid`: Discord server ID.
- `token`: Bot token found on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/).
- `channelfeed`: Channel ID used to notify users when content is available.
- `timerexp`: Time (in milliseconds) before a search expires if the user doesn't respond.

You can set these environment variables in your Docker environment or in a `.env` file.


### Running Shrekbot

Once you have set the environment variables, you can run Shrekbot using Docker:

Pull the Docker image from the package repository:
`docker run -d \
  --name shrekbot \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/donairsauce/shrekbot:master`

Make sure to replace .env with the path to your environment variable file.

## Usage

To interact with Shrekbot, join a Discord server where the bot is present. Use the following command to initiate a search and request content:

- `/request [query]`: Initiates a search and returns the top ten results in a drop-down list.

Once you enter the `/request` command followed by your query, Shrekbot will perform the search and present the results in a drop-down list. The first result will be automatically selected, and its details, including title, description, release date, and poster, will be displayed.

You can change the selection as many times as you want by using the drop-down list to navigate through the list. When you find the desired content, simply click the "Request" button to submit your request.

Shrekbot will process the request and communicate with Ombi to add the selected content to the media library. You will receive a notification when the requested content becomes available.

### Examples:

- `/request Shrek`: Initiates a search for the movie "Shrek" and presents the results.
- `/request Game of Thrones`: Initiates a search for the TV show "Game of Thrones" and presents the results.

Feel free to explore and request your favorite movies and TV shows with Shrekbot!

## Enabling Notifications in Ombi

To enable notifications for content availability, follow these steps in Ombi:

1. Go to Ombi settings.
2. Select the "Notifications" tab.
3. Under the "Webhook" section, check the "Enabled" checkbox.
4. In the "Base Url" field, enter the location where the bot is hosted, followed by `:8154/webhook`. For example, if the bot is hosted at `http://192.168.1.1`, enter `http://192.168.1.1:8154/webhook`.
5. Save the settings.

By enabling notifications in Ombi and providing the correct base URL, Shrekbot will be able to send notifications to the specified channel when the requested content becomes available to watch.
